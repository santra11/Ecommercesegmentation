# E-commerce Segmentation

Suppose I am a consultant for a Brazilian company "Olist" that offers sales solution on online marketplace. The company wants you to provide its e-commerce teams with customer segmentation that they can use on a daily basis for their communication campaign. In this project, I will use unsupervised machine  learning techniques (for example K Means, K-prototype, DBSCAN) to cluster the customer behaviour in terms of their spending.
